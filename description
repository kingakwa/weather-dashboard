# Weather Dashboard 
 Runbook 
0) What you’ll build (in plain words)

A small Python app that:7) (Optional) Tell the app which cities to fetch

The starter app includes defaults. If you want to change them, open src/weather_dashboard.py and look for a CITIES list—edit/add city names like "London", "Douala", "New York". Save the file.

1.calls the OpenWeather API to get current weather for one or more cities,

2. saves the results as timestamped JSON files, and

3. uploads those files into an Amazon S3 bucket in your AWS account for safe storage.


1) Create your accounts & install tools
A. Create your OpenWeather account & API key

Go to OpenWeather and register for a free account, then verify your email.

On your account page, find your API key (sometimes called APPID). Keep it handy.

B. Create (or use) an AWS account

If you don’t have one, sign up at AWS. We’ll use S3 only (which is free/low-cost at small scale).

C. Install the AWS CLI (command-line tool)

Windows, macOS, or Linux: follow the official AWS “Getting Started” guide and install AWS CLI v2.

D. Install Git

If you don’t have Git, install it from git-scm.com (standard defaults are fine).

E. Install Python 3

Install Python 3.10+ from python.org (check “Add Python to PATH” on Windows).

Check your tools

```
python --version
pip --version
aws --version
git --version

```

2) Configure AWS securely (one time)
A. Create an IAM user and access keys (programmatic access)

In AWS Console, open IAM → Users → Create a user (e.g., weather-data-user).

Attach permissions (for learning, you may start with AmazonS3FullAccess, then tighten later).

Create Access key for this IAM user and download the .csv with the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.

You’ll only see the secret once—store it safely.

B. Configure the AWS CLI with your keys

`aws configure`

- Enter: Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Default region (e.g., us-east-1), Default output: json.

- This stores credentials locally for the CLI.

3) Create your S3 bucket
Option 1: AWS Console (easiest)

Open S3 → Create bucket.

Bucket name must be globally unique (e.g., akwa-weather-data-123).

Choose a Region close to you.

Leave “Block Public Access” ON.

Create bucket.

4) Get the project code locally

`git clone https://github.com/ShaeInTheCloud/30days-weather-dashboard.git`
`cd 30days-weather-dashboard`
(That repo name is the reference used across the challenge community.)

5) Create an isolated Python environment & install dependencies
A. Create & activate a virtual environment

macOS/Linux (bash/zsh):
```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
B. Install the required packages

``
pip install -r requirements.txt
``
This will install:

boto3 (AWS SDK for Python),

requests (HTTP),

python-dotenv (loads secrets from .env). 

6) Set your secrets in a .env file

Create a file named .env in the project root with exactly these lines (replace placeholders):

``
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENWEATHER_KEY_HERE
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME_HERE

``
The app uses python-dotenv to read this file at runtime; never commit .env to Git/GitHub.

7) (Optional) Tell the app which cities to fetch

The starter app includes defaults. If you want to change them, open src/weather_dashboard.py and look for a CITIES list—edit/add city names like "London", "Douala", "New York". Save the file.

8) Test your OpenWeather key (sanity check)

Run a quick request in your terminal (replace the key and city):
``
curl "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Douala&appid=YOUR_OPENWEATHER_KEY_HERE&units=metric"
``
You should see JSON output with weather fields (name, main.temp, weather[0].description, etc.).

If you get an error like {"cod":401, "message":"Invalid API key"}, double-check the key and that your email is verified.

9) Run the app

From the project root

```
python src/weather_dashboard.py
``

Expected behavior:

The script prints statuses (fetching each city).

It writes timestamped JSON files into a local data/ folder.

It uploads those JSON files into your S3 bucket.

10) Verify your S3 uploads
In the AWS Console

Open S3 → your bucket → you should see objects under a folder path like weather/YYYY/MM/DD/… (structure may vary).
